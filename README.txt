1. Register --> register by e-mail and password, where we write our name, surname, phone number, bio and role (buyer or seller)
2. Login --> Login by the entered e-mail and password
3. Home Page --> All the photos we see are clickable, whichever pet photo we click in will take us to the Pet Details Page
4. Pet Details Page -->  We can see that the Owner text is blue, which means if we click it, it will take us to the 
			page of the Owner of the pet. At the Owner Page we can see his username,role,bio and a 
			telephone number if he had provided one. If we click on his phone number, it takes us to 
			his WhatsApp. Also, we can see all the pets he has to offer.
5. Pet Details Page --> Add to Favourites button --> Self explanatory, when we click it, it adds the pet to our favourites list
				which we can see at the Sidebar (i will explain that below). 
			When we click the button, it also changes to Remove from favourites immediatelly.
6. Home Page Sorting --> Back at the Home Page we can see 3 dropdown lists at the top.
			1. Filter pets by their type (cat,dog,parrot,monkey...)
			2. Filter pets by their offer (to buy/adopt)
			3. Sort pets by their pricing (lowest to highest / highest to lowest price)
7. The 3 little lines we see at the left corner of the page open up our SideBar when clicked.

9. Favourites button --> We can see all our favourite pets shown as cards, which when we click on they open up
				the Pet Detail Page, which I explained earlier.
10. Settings button --> We have 3 buttons here:
				a. Change password --> When clicked it takes us to another form, where we 
							enter our own password and change it to a new one
				b. Change Bio --> Takes us to another form page and there we can change up our bio with a new one

11. Registering as Buyer vs Seller
	a. Buyer --> Everything I explained till now
	b. Seller --> Everything I explained till now, but also in the SideBar we have another button "Add pet".
